# Project-1.3

Knapsack problem solving.
Make an algorithm that can fit three given parcels (A, B and C) into a given crate with as few spaces possible.
Make an algorithm that can maximise the crate's value knowing that A,B and C now have assigned values.
Make an algorithm that repeats the second. Replace A, B and C parcels with T, L and P pentominoes also with assigned values.
