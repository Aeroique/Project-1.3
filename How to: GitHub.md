Your profile essentially three sections: personal information, your repos and your contributions.

There are 5 tabs on your profile: Overview, Repos, Stars, Followers and Following.

  - Stars are GitHub's equivelant to likes

This page has four main sections: High bar, project information box, source code and a README.md file.

The high bar has 5 publically available tabs plus two more if this is your repo, the wiki and settings tabs.

  1. Code, the files and the source code associated with the repo.
  
  2. Issues, the issues associated with the repo.
  
  3. Pull Requests, pull requests that need reviewing associated with the repo.
  
  4. Projects, *(stub)*
  
  5. Insights, statistics relating to the repo.
  
There are also three buttons above these tabs relevant for interacting with other people. The number next to each button is how many people have also done x with this repo.
