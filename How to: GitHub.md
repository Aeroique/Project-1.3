### Glossary

#### You may need to refer to other definitions within the glossary to understand the keyword you're looking up

*(stub)*: shorthand to say that this piece of information is incomplete or possibly inaccurate due to lack of knowledge or experience.

Branch: A temporary clone of the source code in question.
Can be freely modified without affecting the original.

  - The master branch is **not** a clone but the trunk of the tree, if you will.
  
Commit: Contains all the changes made from the clone or fork of a branch.
The edited code one has commited to submitting.

Documentation, *(stub)*

Fork: A copy of a branch to your repo for you to edit without affecting the source branch. *(stub)*

Issue: An issue can be a bug report, a request for a new feature, a request for help or even a question. 

  - Issues are created with a title and a description called a label.
  
  - Red issues are issues that have been solved (closed) and green issues need fixing still (are open).
  
Pull Request: A notification that a contributor is pushing a commit which needs reviewing before being merged.

Pulling: The master branch taking in code from a contributor.

Pushing: A contributor putting forward code they wish to be added to the master branch of the project.

Release: This is a tricky term to define, think video games that have patches and updates.
Depending on how you want to use releases, it can be either lots of small changes over time, or large differences between releases (patches and updates vs DLC).

Repository: A central location in which data is stored and managed. Repo is shorthand.



### Understanding the UI

#### Black Tool Bar

Icon: GitHub's homepage, appearance differs whether you're signed in or not.

Search bar: To find new projects by repository name. Search options can be configured on the search page.

Pull requests: Shows all pull requests relevant to you. *(stub)*

Issues: Shows all issues relevant to you. *(stub)*

Marketplace: Apps that modify GitHub. Your apps can be viewed at settings> delevoper settings

Explore: Search for sets of repositories that have a joining theme i.e. artificial learning.

The + dropdown menu: for creating new or importing old content i.e. repositories, issues.

The avatar dropdown menu: regular profile settings.


#### Signing up and your Profile Page

Your chosen email can be hidden from public view.

Your account must be verified before using.

Emails are used for keeping you updated about changes made to your repos or the repos you follow. *(stub)*

Your profile essentially three sections: personal information, your repos and your contributions.

There are 5 tabs on your profile: Overview, Repos, Stars, Followers and Following.

  - Stars are GitHub's equivelant to likes
  
  - Following and followers is similar to twitter's setup.
  
This page is mostly self explanitory. Tinker around yourself if you're that interested!


#### Searching for new projects



### Using GitHub

#### Project page

This page has four main sections: High bar, project information area, source code and a README.md file.

###### 1. The high bar

The high bar has 5 publically available tabs plus two more if this is your repo, the wiki and settings tabs.

  1. Code, the files and the source code associated with the repo.
  
  2. Issues, the issues associated with the repo.
  
  3. Pull Requests, pull requests that need reviewing associated with the repo.
  
  4. Projects, *(stub)*
  
  5. Insights, statistics relating to the repo.
  
There are also three buttons above these tabs relevant for interacting with other people. The number next to each button is how many people have also done x with this repo.

  - Watch, allows you to follow this repo so you can be updated on its activity.
  
  - Star, allows you to favourite this repo.
  
  - Fork, allows you to create a clone of this repo.
  
###### 2. Project information area

Holds a short description or useful links for the repo and 5 counters: Commits, branches, releases, contributors and the repo's liscence.

###### 3. Source code area

When you are viewing a specific file from the repo, you will be at the source code interface:

  - Raw, shows you the text as it is written. This is relevant when you want to ignore the flavoured Markdown syntax GitHub uses.
  
  - Blame, reorganises the file in question so that the right side shows you the raw file with some colour coordination and the left side shows you who modified the file, which lines and how long ago.
  In between the two sides are little tags that can show you how the file looked before a blame was made.
  
  - History, Shows you the recent commits made chronologically, along with their contributor.
  
  - Open this file in GitHub Desktop, the name is self explanitory. *(stub)*
  
  - Edit, allows you to modify the text. Can only be done if you're signed in as you can edit only your own repos, else GitHub will automatically fork it you one of your account's repos so you can edit the text.
  
  - Delete, allows you to delete the file. You also need to be signed in for the aforementioned reasons.

###### 4. The README.md file

A decription og the project, its main documents, how to download and use it as well as any additional information.



#### Projects *(stub)*

You can make a new project by creating a new repo, assigning a liscence (defaulting to MIT lisense is recommended). *(stub)*

Projects allow for more micromangaing than a plain old repo does due to the addition of milestones.
Mile stones allow for specific tasks to be set along with a deadline for their completion.



#### Contributing to a repo

Contributing to a repo or a project involve forking, pull requests, cloning, commits, pushing and pulling. It's the actual  practice of all the stuff I've been explaining so far to share code via Git.

###### Git

Git is a source code control system that allows users to sync files together, like drop box, allowing multiple people to have access to the same files despite changes other people may make to them over time.
Git's syncing process tends to follow the same pattern:

1. (Fork and then) clone.

2. Edit.

3. Create a commit.

4. Push commit to the server.

5. Submit a pull request for your commit.


###### How to: Pull request

1. Fork your file or clone it in some way, so you may tinker around with it.

2. Test your changes and make sure your code is ready for use, or for someone else to modify.

3. Submit the file as a pull request rather than committing to the master branch.

4. Title and comment the request so other have an easier time reviewing it.

You may hear terms like head of the fork or base of the fork.
Take the head to mean the file you're pushing and the base to be the place you want it to be added to.


### Documentation and Communication *(stub)*

Wiki, for documentation. *(stub)*
